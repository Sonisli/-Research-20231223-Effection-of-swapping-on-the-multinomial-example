- Description: This research project is a group project, which conducts on Experiments with Differential Private Data Swapping techiniques on the multinomial example from a bayesain perspecitve. The concerns of this project are:
	- Without altering any marginal totals, would a swap algorithm, satisfying DP, impact ϕ, on the n × 2 dataset?
	- If yes, what causes this impact?
	- As data analysts, assume the privatized data we get is trustworthy and analyze it using a naive analysis, what kind of results or errors might we encounter?
